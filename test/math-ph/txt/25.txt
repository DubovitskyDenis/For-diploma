zusammenfassung
der
vorliegenden
arbeit
wird
eine
vollständige
formulierung
des
batalin-vilkovisky
formalismus
rahmen
der
lokal
kovarianten
feldtheorie
vorgeschlagen
er-
sten
teil
der
arbeit
wird
die
klassische
theorie
untersucht
wobei
der
schwerpunkt
auf
die
zugrundeliegenden
unendlich
dimensionalen
strukturen
gelegt
wird
wird
gezeigt
dass
die
anwendung
der
unendlich
dimensionalen
geometrie
eine
konzeptionell
elegante
formulierung
der
theorie
ermöglicht
die
konstruktion
des
bv-komplexes
ist
völlig
ko-
variant
und
eine
abstrakte
verallgemeinerung
auf
der
ebene
funktoren
und
natürlichen
transformationen
wird
vorgegeben
dies
ermöglicht
die
anwendung
des
bv-komplexes
der
klassischen
gravitationstheorie
anschließend
wird
eine
homologische
interpreta-
tion
der
diﬀeomorphismusinvarianten
physikalischen
größen
vorgeschlagen
zweiten
teil
der
arbeit
wird
die
quantentheorie
untersucht
ein
rahmen
für
die
bv-quantisierung
der
vom
pfadintegralformalismus
völlig
unabhängig
ist
und
nur
auf
der
perturbativen
algebraischen
quantenfeldtheorie
basiert
wird
formuliert
solche
formulierung
ermöglichen
wird
zuerst
bewiesen
dass
das
renormierte
zeitgeordnete
produkt
als
eine
binäre
operation
auf
einem
geeigneten
deﬁnitionsbereich
aufgefasst
werden
kann
mittels
dieses
resultats
wird
die
assoziativität
dieses
produkts
gezeigt
und
dadurch
lassen
sich
die
renormierte
strukturen
konsistent
deﬁnieren
insbesondere
werden
die
quantenmastergleichung
und
der
quanten-bv-operator
deﬁniert
dabei
wird
die
master-ward-identität
eine
wichtige
struktur
der
kausalen

benutzt
