een

wanneer
het
geassocieerde
deeltje
bij

wordt
geselecteerd
daardoor
bij
hogere
momentum
fractie
het
nucleaire
gluon
veld
wordt
geen
signiﬁcante
verbreding
geobserveerd
dit
laat
zien
dat
het
saturatie
proces
plaatsvindt
binnen
het
kinematisch
regime
van
rhic
het
transitie
gebied
tussen
het
minder

levert
